Russio_Ukranian War An investigation of democracy. Looking at the brutal nature of the war, and more so the reason for why it began, it was interesting to dive into the history of both nations and study the analysis done of their democracy, thus laying out a clear picture about the state of democracy throughout history, in both the nations. This is a study project done on Mr. Ali. A. Amiriâ€™s Kaggle report and code.
